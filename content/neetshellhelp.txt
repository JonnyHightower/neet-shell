*** Neet Shell Help ***

================
General commands
================
help      -> Print this help
quit      -> Exit the neet shell environment
addresses -> Creates a cross reference of hostnames against IP addresses. Each hostname will be listed
             only once, and all corresponding IP addresses will be listed against the hosts. This is useful
             when testing multiple VLANs where each host may appear more than once with a number of IP
             addresses.
netconfig -> Restore the network configuration for an interface from an ifconfig file. By default
             this will reset the specified interface to its configuration when neet was last run in the
             current directory. Use no argument for usage and a list of available interface configurations.


=============================
Logging commands (neet shell)
=============================
logoff    -> Disable logging
logon     -> Enable logging (default)
logfile   -> Specify the logfile


=======================
Logging commands (neet)
=======================
log       -> View the main neet log file. Pipe it to grep or less for best results.

                Use -h or --help to view all options and many examples.

=================
Running in Screen
=================
  
Running in screen means that it's not as easy to scroll back up through your output history as it
is in a normal terminal. You'll need to do the following to scroll around:

Press CTRL-A followed by left brace "[". You can then scroll up and down using the following key
combinations:
  UP half a page: CTRL-u
  UP a full page: CTRL-b

  Down half a page: CTRL-d
  Down a full page: CTRL-f


=================
Context Switching
=================

refresh    -> Refresh shell aliases and environment variables for short specification of host IP addresses.

To switch to the context of a particular host, type the last unique octet(s) of the IP address. In a 
class C network, this is the last octet. So to switch to 128.98.9.15 you would type 15. In a class B
network, where more than one host has the last octet "15", you would type "9.15". On a class B where
only one host has the last octet "15", you can type 15.

When you are in host context, the host's IP address is available in the environment variable "\$IP",
and the nearest local interface to the host is in the environment variable "\$LOCAL".

-          -> Switch to the last host you were working with. Ideal for toggling between two hosts.

glo        -> Switch to a global view of the results. "\$IP" will be unset.
..         -> Same as "glo"


=========================================================
Commands for connecting to services on a specific machine
=========================================================

Run these commands inside the working directory for the machine. Where neet has determined
credentials for logging into the machine, these credentials will be displayed prior to the
appropriate connection program being started.

sh [port]    -> SSH to the machine.
tnet [port]  -> Telnet to the machine
web [port]   -> Open a web browser to the first web service on the machine
webs         -> Open a web browser tab for each HTTP/S service on the machine
ts           -> Rdesktop to Terminal Services on the machine
vnc          -> VNC to the machine
exploit      -> If the machine has one or more remote vulnerabilities, you will be prompted
                to choose and exploit one


=========================================================
Commands for code execution on Windows hosts
=========================================================
Most of these commands will provide usage instructions if run with no arguments, or with the -h option.

gethash     -> Dump the hashes from the currently-selected host. If the host has been compromised
               automatically by neet, the new account will automatically be used and no username/password
               combination will need to be supplied.

mimikatz    -> Run Mimikatz on the remote host, retrieve the output and parse it for useful credentials.

hivedump    -> Extract the SAM SYSTEM and SECURITY hives from the remote host. Also gets NTDS.dit from
               domain controllers using the Volume Shadow Copy service.


psexec      -> (Windows) - obtain a shell on a windows box. No need to specify credentials if neet has already
               compromised the box.

shell       -> (Windows) - obtain a shell on a windows box. No need to specify credentials if neet has already
               compromised the box. Wrapper for psexec.

meterpreter -> (Windows) - obtain a meterpreter session on a windows box (supply the credentials).

iShellSQL   -> Connects to MS-SQL over its native port and gives a system shell using xp_cmdshell (if enabled).

=============================================================================
Commands for finding information about the host you're currently dealing with.
=============================================================================

The host is selected by using the ip address shortcut command, by entering its directory and typing
"hostmode", or by typing "hostmode" and its IP address.

comp       -> List all ways this machine has been compromised.
name       -> Displays the hostname. You can specify an alternative IP address to look up.
ip         -> Opposite of name. Case insensitive.
os         -> Displays operating system name and version
vuln       -> Displays vulnerabilities on the machine
comp       -> Displays ways in which the machine has been compromised
lowissues  -> List low-risk issues on the machine (not vulnerabilities or compromises)
issues     -> List all issues  on the machine, including vulnerabilities and compromises
svc        -> Lists the services on that machine.
exploit    -> Exploit vulnerabilities on the machine (only the ones marked as "safe")
uexploit   -> Exploit vulnerabilities on the machine (including the ones marked as "unsafe")
info       -> Display information about the host
web [port] -> Launches a web browser, pointed at the first HTTP port on the box (or at port, if specified)
webs       -> Loops through all HTTP/S services on the box
nfsmnt     -> Mounts specified NFS exports from current target
nfsumnt    -> Unmounts all NFS exports from current target
addnetwork -> Add a route to a remote network through the current target
delnetwork -> Delete a route to a remote network through the current target
networks   -> List the routes through the current target


=====================
The Neet Shell Prompt
=====================
->  IN GLOBAL CONTEXT
  A prompt like this: [S:178][H:47 W:19 U:1 O:27] indicates that:
  178 instances of services have been found on the network
  47 Live hosts have been found, of which,
  19 are some flavour of Windows
  1 is some flavour of Unix
  and 27 are other OSs.

-> IN HOST CONTEXT
  A prompt like this: [128.98.9.15][Compromised][Windows] shows the IP address of the host you
  are working with, its condition, and its operating system family (if available).

==============
REPORTING AIDS
===============
nonames  -> Will show IP addresses in output, rather than hostnames. This is the default behaviour.
usenames -> Will show hostnames in output, rather than IP addresses.
useboth  -> Will show IP addresses AND hostnames in output, where possible.

memo [message] -> Use with a message to add a time-stamped memo entry to the log. Use with no arguments
       to read all memo entries.

search <File> <string> -> Perform a search of all files beginning with "File" for string "string".
     Useful for compiling lists of results. 

     For example, look for all Compaq HTTP Servers of a particular version in Nikto results:
     > search nikto CompaqHTTPServer/9.9

     The search "find"s all files with names matching "nikto*", and greps them for the string
     "CompaqHTTPServer/9.9".

     You can list nearly all nikto output with this:
     > search nikto +

     Another example, look for all weak SSL configurations:
     > search issues "short keys"

     Look for all Accepted SSL/TLS ciphers:
     > search sslscan Accept

iponly  ->  Filter to show only IP addresses from command output.
            Example: svc https | iponly will show only the IP addresses of https services.

socket  -> Filter to show only IP addresses and ports from command output.
           Example: svc https | socket will show only the IP addresses and ports of https services.

sock    -> Alias for socket. Use in the same context.


======================================
IN-SCAN TUNING AND MONITORING COMMANDS
======================================

budget     -> Sets a new overall performance budget. The default value is set in the configuration file.
              The lower the budget, the fewer scans can run simultaneously. Use with no arguments to make
              neet display the current budget.
load       -> Set a new load average target for neet's automatic budget management.

disable    -> Disable the specified GSM module.
enable     -> Re-enable a GSM module which has been disabled with the "disable" command.

threads    -> Display all the Neet threads which are currently running.
queue      -> Show a list of the services queued for processing by the GSM
debug      -> toggle the debug level between 0,1,2 and 3.
gsmsummary -> Display a list of loaded GSM modules and the service files being watched by each.

cancel     -> (In host mode) Cancels all scans of the current host.

Note: Do not use these two unless you really know how the modules work:
addinstance <module> -> Increments the Maximum allowed number of concurrent instances for the specified module.
delinstance <module> -> Decrements the Maximum allowed number of concurrent instances for the specified module.

pause      -> Pauses the current scan. Same as CTRL-C in the main UI window.
=====================
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=====================

A number of variables are set in the neet shell, depending on whether you're in host or global mode.

$IP      -> In host mode, this contains the IP address of the target host.
$LOCAL   -> In host mode, this contains the IP address of the nearest local interface to the target.
            This is usually eth0, but if you are scanning from a number of interfaces, this will contain
            the IP address of the one used to route to the target. Useful for setting up reverse
            connections back to your laptop.
$MSF2    -> Absolute path to neet's Metasploit 2 installation.
$MSF     -> Absolute path to the system's Metasploit 4 installation.
